# Frontend Testing Guide for Tax Management System

## Quick Start: Get Test Data in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Reset and Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

### Step 2: Seed the Database
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Step 3: Start the Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```

That's it! Now you have test data to see all dashboards working.

## Quick Commands Reference

### Fresh Start (Delete all data and re-seed)
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Re-seed without deleting
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=NewsSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=PaymentSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=ComplaintSeeder
```

### Check Database
```bash
php artisan tinker
# Then run:
User::count();
Payment::count();
News::count();
Complaint::count();
```

---

## Customizing Test Data

### Add More Users
Edit `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php`

### Add More Payments
Edit `database/seeders/PaymentSeeder.php`

### Add More News
Edit `database/seeders/NewsSeeder.php`

### Add More Complaints
Edit `database/seeders/ComplaintSeeder.php`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist"
**Solution:** Run migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Issue: "No data showing"
**Solution:** Run seeders
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Issue: "Can't login"
**Solution:** Reset password or create new user
```bash
# In php artisan tinker
$user = User::where('email', 'admin@test.com')->first();
$user->password = Hash::make('password');
$user->save();
```

### Issue: "Route not found"
**Solution:** Clear cache
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

## Notes for Frontend Developer

1. **All data is from the database now** - no more session storage for payments/news
2. **Each taxpayer sees only their own data** - payment history is filtered by user
3. **Admin sees all data** - statistics aggregate all users
4. **Interviewer data is still demo** - waiting for backend implementation
5. **You can modify seeders** to change data as needed for testing

---

## Running Individual Seeder Classes

If you want to test specific data in isolation:

```bash
# Seed only users
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder

# Seed only payments
php artisan db:seed --class=PaymentSeeder

# Seed only news
php artisan db:seed --class=NewsSeeder

# Seed only complaints  
php artisan db:seed --class=ComplaintSeeder
```

---

## Tips

1. **Use different browsers/incognito** for testing different user roles simultaneously
2. **Modify seeder numbers** to get more/less test data
3. **Check database directly** using `php artisan tinker`
4. **Keep seeders as your test data source** - modify them as you build features
5. **Don't worry about data persistence** - just re-seed when you need fresh data

Happy Testing! ðŸŽ‰
